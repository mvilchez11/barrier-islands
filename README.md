# barrier-islands

Welcome!

This is part of the University of Florida's environmental journalism class project on Florida's barrier islands (2023).

In this repository you will find GIS layers and spreadsheets used to create the interactive barrier islands maps from WUFT's Living on the Edge series. The Census Tract data was gathered and polished by Rich Doty, GIS Coordinator & Research Demographer from UF's Bureau of Economic and Business Research. The maps were made using ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online. The data was analzyed by Mariaguadalupe Vilchez.

Quick Summary:
Populations on barrier islands continue to grow despite sea-level rise and frequent storms. However, Florida politics and policies continue to support the rise in barrier island populations. A new GIS data analysis identifies Florida's major inhabited barrier islands and tracks population growth over a decade using the 2010 and 2020 Census data.
